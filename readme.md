# Angular Assessment

End of week five

Today you will be building a small AngularJS application that will be handling messages.

Objective: Your application will have a single text input and a single button. You should be allowed to enter text into the text box, and when the button is clicked:

The view should expose the words 'Message is: ' followed by the value that was sent.
The 'Message is: ' label should NOT be show until there is a value to show.
The input should be cleared out
When you enter a second value and click the button the following should happen:

The previous value corresponding with 'Message is: ' should be replaced with the newly entered value.
Previous value should be added to a list that will be labeled on the view: 'Previous messages are:'.
So as each new message is added, it should continue to move from the 'Message is: ' to 'Previous messages are:'.
The 'Previous messages are:' label should NOT be visible until there are previous messages to show.
The input should be cleared out
Also, remember to use the controllerAs syntax.
